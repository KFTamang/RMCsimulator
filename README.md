# What is RMC?
Rotation Modulation Collimator(RMC) is a type of optics used in high energy X-ray/Gamma-ray telescopes,
where constructing lenses or mirror is not possible.
RMC consists of two planes of slits alligned palallel to each other and a detector.
The detector doesn't have to be position sensitive and the image is constructed from the count rate of the detector 
(i.e. how many photons are detected in the deteector) through a mathematical process.
This type of imaging method is called indirect imaging (as opposed to direct imager, where lenses or mirrors are in use).

# What is RMCsimulator?
RMCsimulator is a simulator of an optic of RHESSI spacecraft, as an example of RMC.
This is to encourage the understanging of how RMC works and how images are constructed.

# Visualizer
The author is familiar with ROOT analysis framework and not with other visualization framework such as MATLAB or matplotlib.
Although ROOT is quite a powerful environment to visualize data, installing it just for this code is a bit (or lot) of pain.
So, the visualization section is written seperately from the simulation section.


Any suggestion is welcome!
